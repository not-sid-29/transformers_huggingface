# HuggingFace ðŸ¤— and Transformers
A Repository containing introductory practice notebooks for using Transformer architectures using HuggingFace Ecosystem. <br>
---
## Notebook-1: Basic Usage of Transformer models: <br>
> The notebook explores the usage of transformer pipelines for various NLP focused tasks<br>
---
## Notebook-2: Diving Deeper to Explore pipelines: <br>
>This notebook explores various components of the high-level `pipeline` API present in HuggingFace Ecosystem.
---
## Notebook-3: Creating and Calling Transformer Objects: <br>
> This notebook explores transformer models like `BERT` and how does the `config` method load the transformer, and how the `from_pretrained` method loads up transformer models, and How do they differ.
--- 
## Notebook-4: Working with Tokenizers: <br>
> This notebook goes one-level deeper into the huggingface ecosystem to demonstrate how tokenizers help in preprocessing the data, and what are the different approaches to tokenizer a raw text.
